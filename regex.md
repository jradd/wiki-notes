# Regular Expressions
Bash, Zsh, Python mostly.


### Anchoring  
`^` and `$` are meta-characters that respectively match empty string
at beginning and end of line.

### Char Classes  
`[a-b]` in range 
`^[a-b]` *not* in range

### Expressions  

`[:alnum:]` `[:alpha:]` `[:cntrl:]` `[:digit:]` `[:graph:]`
`[:lower:]` `[:print:]` `[:punct:]` `[:space:]` `[:upper:]`
`[:xdigit:]`

`[[:alnum:]]` ==> `[0-9A-Za-z]`


### Repitition  


| Expression  | Representation       |     misc   |
| ----------- |:--------------------:|:----------:|
| `?`         | [?p <= 1]            | `{lte 1}`  |
| `*`         | [p <= 0]             | `{lte 0}`  |
| `+`         | [p >= 1]             | `{gte 1}`  |
| `{n}`       | [p = n]              | `{e}`      |
| `{n,}`      | [p >= n]             | `{gte,}`   |
| `{n,m}`     | [(p >= n), (p <= m)] | `{gte,lte}`|

### Concatenation  
Two RE may be concatenated; resulting RE matches any string formed by
concatenating two substrings that respectively match the concatenated 
expression.

### Alternation  
Join two REGEX by joining with the infix operator `|;`

##### Precedence  
`Repitition` takes precedence over `concatenation` which in turn takes
precedence over `alternation`.

###### Basic VS Extended  
Basic     --> escape expressions (eg; `\?`)
Extended  --> no need to escape
          `[{]` matches literal "{"  

## Cheat Sheet / Reference   

|Char| Function       |
|:-:|:----------------|
|^|	Start of a string.|
|$|	End of a string.|
|.|	Any character (except \n newline)|
|	Alternation.|
|{...}|	Explicit quantifier notation.|
|[...]|	Explicit set of characters to match.|
|(...)|	Logical grouping of part of an expression.|
|*|	0 or more of previous expression.|
|+|	1 or more of previous expression.|
|?|	0 or 1 of previous expression; also forces minimal matching when an expression might match several strings within a search string.|
|\|	Preceding one of the above, it makes it a literal instead of a special character. Preceding a special matching character, see below.|

| Value | Action |
|:-:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|\a|	Matches a bell (alarm) \u0007.|
|\b|	Matches a backspace \u0008 if in a []; otherwise matches a word boundary (between \w and \W characters).|
|\t|	Matches a tab \u0009.|
|\r|	Matches a carriage return \u000D.|
|\v|	Matches a vertical tab \u000B.|
|\f|	Matches a form feed \u000C.|
|\n|	Matches a new line \u000A.|
|\e|	Matches an escape \u001B.|
|\040|	Matches an ASCII character as octal (up to three digits); numbers with no leading zero are backreferences if they have only one digit or if they correspond to a capturing group number. (For more information, see Backreferences.) For example, the character \040 represents a space.|
|\x20|	Matches an ASCII character using hexadecimal representation (exactly two digits).|
|\cC|	Matches an ASCII control character; for example \cC is control-C.|
|\u0020|	Matches a Unicode character using a hexadecimal representation (exactly four digits).|
|\*|	When followed by a character that is not recognized as an escaped character, matches that character. For example, \* is the same as \x2A.|
|.|	Matches any character except \n. If modified by the Singleline option, a period character matches any character. For more information, see Regular Expression Options.|
|[aeiou]|	Matches any single character included in the specified set of characters.|
|[^aeiou]|	Matches any single character not in the specified set of characters.|
|[0-9a-fA-F]|	Use of a hyphen (â€“) allows specification of contiguous character ranges.|
|\p{name}|	Matches any character in the named character class specified by {name}. Supported names are Unicode groups and block ranges. For example, Ll, Nd, Z, IsGreek, IsBoxDrawing.|
|\P{name}|	Matches text not included in groups and block ranges specified in {name}.|
|\w|	Matches any word character. Equivalent to the Unicode character categories [\p{Ll}\p{Lu}\p{Lt}\p{Lo}\p{Nd}\p{Pc}]. If ECMAScript-compliant behavior is specified with the ECMAScript option, \w is equivalent to [a-zA-Z_0-9].|
|\W|	Matches any nonword character. Equivalent to the Unicode categories [^\p{Ll}\p{Lu}\p{Lt}\p{Lo}\p{Nd}\p{Pc}]. If ECMAScript-compliant behavior is specified with the ECMAScript option, \W is equivalent to [^a-zA-Z_0-9].|
|\s|	Matches any white-space character. Equivalent to the Unicode character categories [\f\n\r\t\v\x85\p{Z}]. If ECMAScript-compliant behavior is specified with the ECMAScript option, \s is equivalent to [ \f\n\r\t\v].|
|\S|	Matches any non-white-space character. Equivalent to the Unicode character categories [^\f\n\r\t\v\x85\p{Z}]. If ECMAScript-compliant behavior is specified with the ECMAScript option, \S is equivalent to [^ \f\n\r\t\v].|
|\d|	Matches any decimal digit. Equivalent to \p{Nd} for Unicode and [0-9] for non-Unicode, ECMAScript behavior.|
|\D|	Matches any nondigit. Equivalent to \P{Nd} for Unicode and [^0-9] for non-Unicode, ECMAScript behavior.|
